# Authenticate to GMail
#
# If your Gmail account is secured with two-factor authentication, you need
# to generate a unique App Password to use in ssmtp.conf.
# See https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833
# App Passwords can be generated on https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#
# Use your Gmail username (not the App Name) in the AuthUser line and use the
# generated 16-character password in the AuthPass line, spaces in the password
# can be omitted.
#
# If you do not use two-factor authentication, you need to allow access to
# unsecure apps. You can do so on your Less Secure Apps page.
# See https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255
